Everything alpha for now.

##### Preview
Version 2015.10.18: http://cdn.rawgit.com/tommiehansen/lightRange/master/test.html

This version has a lot of testing-stuff littering test.html for things such as testing different colors etc via colorPicker (html5) or Google Material Design etc.

Current:
Debating showing next/prev months within a view since it can be somewhat confusing and isn't reallt needed when showing 2x calendars. It only is good when swithing to mobile (under 500px) and when 1x calendar month is visible. The next/prev-months also add a lot of additional javascript and if-statements.
