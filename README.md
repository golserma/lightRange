# lightRange
##### Main goal
Date range picker under 5kb (compiled, non-gzip) specifically for flight- and hotel dates selection.

Everything alpha for now.

Preview of version 2015.10.28: **http://cdn.rawgit.com/tommiehansen/lightRange/master/test.html**

Current:
Debating showing next/prev months within a view since it can be somewhat confusing and isn't reallt needed when showing 2x calendars. It only is good when swithing to mobile (under 500px) and when 1x calendar month is visible. The next/prev-months also add a lot of additional javascript and if-statements.
